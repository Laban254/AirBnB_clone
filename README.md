AirBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end AA                                                  
PI, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                   
The project currently only implements the back-end console.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                   
## Classes üÜë                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                   
HolbertonBnB utilizes the following classes:                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                   
## Storage üõÑ                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                   
The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the Fii                                                  
leStorage class.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                   
Every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB instantiates an instance of                                                    
FileStorage called storage. The storage object is loaded/re-loaded from any class                                                  
s instances stored in the JSON file file.json. As class instances are created, uu                                                  
pdated, or deleted, the storage object is used to register corresponding changess                                                  
 in the file.json. 

## Console üíª                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                   
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backendd                                                  
 of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized bb                                                  
y the application (achieved by calls on the storage object defined above).

The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. Too                                                  
 run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the filee

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:
